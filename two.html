        <h2> Sustainable Denim Brands Versus Fast Fashion Denim Brands </h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>sustainable denim brand</strong> is a brand that incorporates measures
          throughout its production chain to reduce its environmental footprint.
         </br>
         </br>
          In an opposing light, a <strong>fast fashion denim brand</strong> is a brand that mass produces
          clothing to keep up with current trends and does not prioritize its
          environmental footprint.
