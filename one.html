        <h2>What is Sustainable Denim?</h2>

        <!-- Paragraph describing the concept of sustainable denim-->
        <p>
          Sustainable denim involves denim that has been produced with the accountability of the environmental issues to reduce the amount of environmental impact from
          denim production and preserve natural resources.
          </br>
          </br>
          You might question where sustainable denim comes from? Well, sustainable denim strives from the sustainable fashion movement with
          a specific focus on the production and use of denim. The sustainable fashion movement targets four different key issues, which include waste creation,
          chemical usage, energy emissions, and water consumption and contamination.
          </br>
          </br>
          Sustainable denim tackles waste creation by focusing on reducing the amount of clothing and materials that are sent to landfills or disposed of.
          Sustainable denim focuses on reducing and eliminating the use of pesticides and chemical for material production to help battle the
          issue of chemical usage. Sustainable denim challenges energy consumption, water consumption, and contamination by using effective drying, ironing, and washing methods for denim
          products.

        <h2>Problems with Current Denim Production</h2>

        <p>
          The production of denim has several negative impacts on the environment demonstrating the need for sustainable denim in the current fashion market.
          </br>
          </br>
          For example,
        </p>

        <!-- List describing the issues with denim production-->
        <ul class="article">
          <li>Genetically modified cotton is heavily used in the production of denim. Cotton production tends to use large amounts of water.</li>
          </br>
          <li>Cotton production involves the use of various insecticides and pesticides, which pose health risks to the local ecosystem and organisms.</li>
          </br>
          <li>Chemicals, including toxic substances, used to dye cotton fibers can be dumped into the waterways of developing countries producing denim.</li>
          </br>
          <li>Subprocesses that make denim softer and lighter colors involve the use of vast amounts of water.</li>
          </br>
          <li>Denim can be composed using synthetic fibers that cannot be decomposed or recycled resulting in an increased amount of waste in landfills.</li>
        </ul>
